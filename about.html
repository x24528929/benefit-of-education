					<h5>HOW WE DO IT</h5>
					<br>
					<p>
						There are many ways for us to contribute to spreading education all over the world. First of all we hold fundraisers to gather donations up to help provide resources to areas less fortunate than ours. This money will go to building schools, providing infrastructure, buying books and copies for students and paying teachers. We can also donate books and stationary items, as these will be collected together and dispersed fairly to the areas that need them the most. Latsly we can also make an impact in our area, we can volunteer at schools which are lacking facilities and help out for the day trying to teach students or even make a small impact in their lives.
