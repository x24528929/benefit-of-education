					<p>Books and schools would be the primary resource for people all over the world to gain an education. Schools are great as you have teachers to guide you in learning, sometimes from your own inititive and if you ever come across a hurdle, they will help you through it. You also have multiple subjects to study and plenty of students to work together with, opening the room for discussions and debates. Books are a great tool to learn from the knowledge of others. As Newton once said "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. It is said that if you read 3 books on 1 topic you are more informed on that topic than 90% of the population. Another great thing about books is that if you don't like what you're learning you can put it down and pick something else up.</p>

					<h5>Debates</h5>
					<p>Debates and public discourse are also some of the most important ways we can become educated as a community. As people from all backgrounds can come together and discuss pressing matters and how it affects them, they are also able to bounce ideas off each other in order to find a solution. Public discourse has been around for thousand of years and many famous speakers and their speaches are immortalised in history. Such as Socrates 'Apology' in 399 BC or Abhraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863. </p>					
					<br>
					<p> We believe that engaging in debates or even listening to public discourses can help influence society in a positive way. How can you know if you truely believe in something if you haven't been challenged on it or asked the right questions. Try engage your friends on a friendly debate to see how you get on!</p>

					<h5>Learning from family and everyday life</h5>
					<p>You do not necessarily need a formal education to learn, some people may not be as fortunate to have access to schools, books or even the ability to hear debates. The next best thing is informal education such as learning from your family, like how to walk, how to speak. Eventually you learn manners and societal standards. Usually what you learn from your parents stick with you for an entire lifetime. The everyday experienes of life can also teach you many things. Life works in mysterious ways, sometimes it gives you a lesson when you are least expecting it.</p>					
					<p>
						Here are some topics your family or life can teach you on!
					</p>
					<p> •Moral and ethicical values </p>
					<p> •Cultural Knowledge</p>					
					<p>•Communication Skills </p>
